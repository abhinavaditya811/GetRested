									Jim Carrey easily makes the short list of history's most
									influential comedians, but in an interview with 60 Minutes,
									the funnyman shocked a lot of people when he acknowledged he
									has spent much of his life dealing with depression. After the
									second of his two failed marriages, Carrey sought the help of
									a psychiatrist who prescribed him Prozac. Though Carrey admits
									the antidepressant helped him out of an initial jam, he also
									realized that he couldn't be one of those who stay on the drug
									forever. "I had to get off [Prozac] at a certain point," said
									Carrey. "You need to get out of bed every day and say that
									life is good. That's what I did, although at times it was very
									difficult for me." Carrey credits a healthy diet and natural
									supplements for his improved mental health.

									In 1998, shortly after she revealed that she was gay, Ellen
									Degeneres's popular sitcom was axed. "Everything that I ever
									feared happened to me," Degeneres later recalled. "I lost my
									show. I've been attacked like hell. I went from making a lot
									of money on a sitcom to making no money. When I walked out of
									the studio after five years of working so hard, knowing I had
									been treated so disrespectfully for no other reason than I was
									gay, I just went into this deep, deep depression." But the
									comedienne persevered, continuing in the industry, and
									ultimately finding acceptance and happiness with an
									Emmy-winning talk show and an unforgettable turn as a fish
									with amnesia in Pixar's Finding Nemo franchise.

									Actor Johnny Depp may be a chameleon on screen, but watch him
									during any interview, and you'll see only a man whose facial
									expressions, droopy posture, and mumbled words give away what
									was once a big secret: Depp suffers from severe anxiety.
									Indeed, the actor's anxiety has been a major source of
									depression and unease, so much so that Depp has access to
									therapists at all times, even on film sets, who help advise
									him on how best to deal with his anxiety and keep it from
									dragging him into severe depression.

									In his memoir, The Way I Am, Eminem goes into detail about his
									battle with depression more than a decade ago. Though the
									rapper grew up through tough circumstances, in 2006 he found
									himself reeling after the murder of his close friend and D12
									member Proof. His continuously rocky relationship with his
									ex-wife wasn't helping either. Eminem recalled, "I have never
									felt so much pain in my life. It was tough for me to even get
									out of bed and I had days when I couldn't walk, let alone
									write a rhyme."
